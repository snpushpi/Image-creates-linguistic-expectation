# final_study_v2
 Analysis of the Second Version of the collected final data

-final_results_prelim_v2.csv, it’s essentially all the raw data with random information about the data(for example, timestamp, what each row means, #s etc) stripped off of the collected data of ibex, I also added Condition_ID there to help experimenting with error rate if needed
-error_ind.csv, a df with sentence, subject_ID, condition_ID and whether or not a certain participant made mistake in a certain sentence, which is referred to as “correctness” column
-final_study_all_data_v2.csv is the preprocessed data with all the information such as POS, Frequency, length, surprisal etc
-final_data_analysis.Rmd - the markdown notebook with analysis
-final_data_analysis.html - the knitted html notebook (outdated) 
-saved_models - folder with all the saved models, to understand which model is what, pls check the markdown notebook
-scatterplots.ipynb - this notebook has a bunch of plots and scatterplots for visualization and learning
